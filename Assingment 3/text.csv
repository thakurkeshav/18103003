<p>,"Commander L. R. Parkash introduced the concept of port addresses and NAT. NAT maps private IP address to public IP address. The main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use, for both economy and security purposes. Port addresses are used to send packets to particular application on a system. Some services or processes have conventionally assigned permanent port numbers. These are known as well-known port numbers. In other cases, a port number is assigned temporarily (for the duration of the request and its completion) from a range of assigned port numbers. Various security features and attacks in this model are elaborated with suitable examples. For example, there may be DoS or DDoS attack on the web server by sending multiple bogus requests to web server to occupy all ports on server. Natting makes provisions such that no outside packet can reach to private network. Net neutrality concept and implications were discussed with students. ISP may peep into personalized traffic to route traffic differently to different users. Further, the speaker talked about Virtual Private Networks. VPN technology was developed as a way to allow remote users and branch offices to securely access corporate applications and other resources. To ensure safety, data travels through secure tunnels and VPN users must use authentication methods -- including passwords, tokens and other unique identification methods -- to gain access to the VPN. Session ended with Cmdr. Parkash motivating the students to thoroughly study basic and advanced communication infrastructure over the internet and create solutions to our day-to-day problems."
<p>,"Cmdr. L. R. Parkash started the session discussing about Virtual Private Network (VPN) Tunneling. VPN Tunneling has three components Carrier, Passenger and Encapsulation of data. A thorough explanation of how the data is transmitted and encapsulated over VPN was given. Tunneling can be done site-to-site or through remote access in VPNs. The various advantages of VPN include greater scalability, mobility, security, cost effectiveness, etc. The major disadvantages of VPN are unpredictable internet traffic and understanding of different security issues. A brief presentation was given on the topic of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) which is used to obtain MAC address from a given IP address. ARP is a stateless protocol which does two jobs that are, responding to a query and ownership announcement. ARP cache tables are maintained to map MAC addresses from IP addresses. The major drawback of ARP is ARP spoofing. ARP announcements are not authenticated, the requests are not tracked and ARP tables can be easily poisoned by man-in-the-middle attack. Various solutions to ARP spoofing involve software-detection solutions such as Xarp, ArpWatch, Anti-arpspoof and MAC binding. The speaker ended the lecture with a amall talk on TCP Session Hijacking, Droppers and BotNets."

<p>,"Under DST sponsored project of “Big Data Analytics – HSRS Data (BDA-HSRS)”, Dr L. N Sharma, Associate Professor, Department of Applied Sciences, PEC University of Technology has been awarded a project as Co-PI with research grant of Rs 21 Lakh to study snow and glaciers. It is a cluster of multi-institutional national networked project. Dr Sharma happens to be among top researchers who have been selected from prestigious organisations of national repute like IIT- Bombay, Kanpur, Chennai, Kharagpur, IIST-ISRO, DTRL, DRDO, IARI and Central Universities etc it said. It will involve 4 Region-wise central laboratory facilities which will also maintain data acquired. The IIT- Bombay has been identified as national nodal agency to coordinate and maintain data portal of the project through setting up a coordination cell. Total duration of the project is 3 years. The project involves characterization of physical and optical properties of different forms of snow and glaciers using ground truth data collection and remote sensing techniques, he pointed out. The physical process analysis of snow features will provide crucial information to understand and model the snow physical parameters. This will help in creating a data base of such processes from field input and up scaling them on satellite data and thus will help in better understanding of snow and glacier formation. The major beneficiaries of the output of the project will be Army, BRO, DRDO, Deptt of Space Labs, MoEF, MoES, Hydroelectric Energy Producers, Agriculture operators etc. Having second project on glaciers to his credit, Dr Sharma is involved in paleoclimatic studies of glaciers (Hamtah and Siachin) for more than a decade is opined that west Himalayan glaciers are definitely retreating due to global warming. Right from its origin i.e 4600 million years earth had five ice ages. The variations in the Earth’s orbit and shifting plate tectonics spur the waxing and waning of these periods. At present we are living in the interglacial warmer period, hence geologically speaking there is nothing abnormal about global warming. However, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases and intensive use of fossil fuels have alarmed the situation to such an extent that human beings own existence is at stake."
<p>,"The event was co-ordinated by Dr. R Sehmi and Dr. Sucheta of Mathematics section and Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, Dr. Prem Lata, Dr. Gyaneshwar and Dr. Kirtanjot of Physics and Chemistry section respectively. Dr. Vasundhara Singh, Head, Applied Sciences thanked one and all for making the event a great success."
